# TODO List

## What is it?

A simple TODO list add-on for the Godot game engine. It looks at all GDScript (.gd) files and built-in scripts within all scenes(.tscn, .scn, .xscn) 
for lines containing **TODO:** or **FIXME:** and displays them accordingly.

> **Features:**
> 
> - GDScript files can be double-clicked to open for editing. 
> - Built-in scripts require that the containing scene be open.
> - Automatically look for TODOs and FIXMEs
