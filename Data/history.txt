_____The Minions are a species of artificial life--machines that
serve the purposes of their extra-galactic master-species.  Eons ago, the
master-species seeded the ancestor-units of the Minions on a planet
chosen to accelerate their developmental programs. 
Their ultimate programming lay dormant throughout their history until
reawakened by their cosmic masters.  No one knows anything about the
location of the masters or their purpose.
@@_____The Minions are made up of microscopic, self-maintaining machines, and they are able to assimilate other
life forms to obtain the rich mixture of elements they need for power and self-maintenance.  They are
efficient and unstoppable at taking over worlds.  They are built for strength and speed, and no known
species can stand against a Minion in an unarmed confrontation.  They infiltrate, assimilate, and control
worlds with great speed and have been known to take over an entire planet and its population in hours.

_____The Snovemdomas evolved as pack-hunting predators in woods and tundra plains on a very high-gravity world. 
Snovemdomas are about the size of a bear, and their stocky build is deceptive since they are quick and
graceful in motion.  To the inhabitants of other worlds, they appear to be imposing and massive.  On their
own world, the Snovemdomas preyed on much larger and tougher creatures, bringing the prey down by
overwhelming it with numbers and speed.  Their bodies evolved
strength and lightness (too much mass being detrimental in high gravity), and their bones are made of a hollow
but nearly unbreakable force-distributing honeycomb lattice.
@@_____Because of the high-gravity environment on their home world they have
always had to allow for greater stress in
designing their dwellings and machines. 
Their material science is advanced and they make use of strong, light
composite materials in their construction.  It is in their nature to design ships
that can withstand great force.

_____The Orfa are grazing animals that evolved on a hostile world. 
Their bodies are very dense and tough, and they are as happy in a pool of lava as pigs
are in a wallow of filth.  They prefer vegetation and a diet of complex
organic molecules but they can subsist on
raw minerals.  They are not harmed by the radiation, heat, cold, chemicals, or physical buffeting of any
known planetary body, nor do they require an atmosphere.
@@_____They have no known natural enemies (nothing on their home world is able to make a dent in their
impregnable hides) and no particular difficulty surviving in almost any environment.  It is likely that they
evolved sentience due to competition for mating.  They have seventeen
sexes, so finding sixteen mates of the appropriate sex (so they can have one of their litters, numbering in the hundreds)
is their central preoccupation.  They have unbelievably complicated and difficult cultural mores centering around
mating competition, and an Orfa who mates successfully usually gets to
do so by outsmarting many of its peers.  Thus they are very intelligent and are able to perceive subtle causes of events and fine
levels of meaning.  They are also happy to loaf once they have fulfilled their mating imperative.

@@_____The Frutmaka move with glacial slowness.  They are near-sessile
fungal animals that obtained high intelligence early in their evolution. 
Their frustration at being fully aware and helpless while they were
eaten alive by predators gave way to the development of a latent telekinetic
ability.  No one knows when it was that a Frutmaka first lashed out
with its mind at its tormentors, but modern Frutmaka have a
formidable ability to teleport objects with the force of their wills.
@@_____They are able to combine their ability, and when massed together they can
teleport large objects across huge distances.  The Frutmaka believe that
Graveesha gave them the power to teleport objects for the purpose of making
sacrifices.  They will occasionally teleport enemies to Graveesha
to maintain harmony with their god.  It is not known precisely what happens
